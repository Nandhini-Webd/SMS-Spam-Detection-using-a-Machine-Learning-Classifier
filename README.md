# SMS-Spam-Detection-using-a-Machine-Learning-Classifier
The aim of this project is to classify the SMS into ham or spam messages. The dataset collected from the UCI machine learning repository is given as input to the proposed system . The data has been classified as HAM or SPAM using the Passive-Aggressive classifier.The text preprocessing steps such as stop words removal , punctuation removal , stemming , lematization are done using the nltk library in python.We have used TF-IDF vectorization which converts all the processed text into vectors that are best suited for the Passive-Aggressive classifier. Using TF-IDF gives better results in data processing.The results obtained from the Passive-Aggressive algorithm achieves an accuracy rate of 99% which is higher than the Naive Bayes with Neural network which is 97%.Effective results have been produced from this work. This research can be taken into real world application for detecting and differentiating SMS ham and spam messages.
